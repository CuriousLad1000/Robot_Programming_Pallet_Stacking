# Robot programming: using RAPID to program a palletizer robot

## Introduction

Automation is already an integral part of the industries and has played
a major role in propelling the new technological innovations in our
modern society. Automation makes machines smarter and more efficient.
Automation in robots makes them smarter. The field of robotics will
continue to grow in future as we dive deeper into the realm of
Artificial Intelligence, which will inevitably make are machines smarter
and more reliable.

## Project Objective

The following mini project was done with the objective of learning by
exploring way in which ABB's robots are programmed and the way robots
are programmed and automated in general.

The objective is to program IRB6620 industrial robot by ABB for
palletizing task. The task was also a robotics course challenge included
as a part in my Master's studies.

> *More details on the challenge are given in wiki.*

## Software used

-   ABB RobotStudio (*RAPID programming*)

## Features offered

-   The robot can stack boxes in the order described in the challenge.

-   The function used for stacking boxes takes number of layers to stack
    as argument to change dynamically the number of boxes to stack
    without the need to reprogram.

-   Only 4 target markers used to represent positions and orientations
    of the boxes on the pallet.
